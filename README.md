# DECFusion
Code of DECFusion: a self-supervised image fusion network for multiple image fusion tasks, including multi-modal (VIS-IR) image fusion.

## Tips:<br>
Due to file size issues, the training set has been removed from the code and the MSRS dataset can be downloaded here: https://github.com/Linfeng-Tang/MSRS
Place the downloaded training dataset under: dataset/MSRS/ path.

## To Train
Run "python main.py" to train the model.
The training data are selected from the MSRS dataset. 

## To Test
Run "python evalFuse.py" to test the model.
The images generated by the test will be placed under the result/Fuse path.
